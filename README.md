# Real-Time-Credit-Card-Transaction-Fraud-Detection

Predicting Credit Card Fraud using Random Forest ML in near real-time

# Credit Card Fraud Detection using traditional Machine Learning Techniques (Random Forest with Python Scikit-Learn)


# The Problem:

Both the card issuer and the merchant are liable in the event of fraud, most of the fraud detection efforts are being directed towards the card issuer (the Bank) and merchants are left with no real tools to protect themselves.  Most local SME’s still use rule-based techniques to detect fraud. This solution was relevant back then when Zimbabwe had a stable economy, now these complex rules have to be constantly be rewritten at every turn to avoid incorrect classification of transactions. Bigger organisations can afford develop in house solutions that are not available to the public leaving SME’s exposed to attackers. As a result of this most businesses in Zimbabwe hesitate in the adoption of technology in their business processes because of fear of the risks associated with transacting online. 



# THE OBJECTIVE: 

To build a fraud detection classifier that, given a new transaction, can tell us if it is fraudulent or not with a correspondent confidence level. # Which are our classes? : 

“0” label = transaction is NOT fraudulent
“1” label (transaction IS fraudulent)

# EXPECTED RESULTS:

•	A model that can classify transactions as normal or fraudulent in real time\n
•	A model with an accuracy score of at least 80%\n
•	The model is to be deployed using a REST API
